= Solarized Theme Plugin

== Introduction

This plugin provides Solarized (Light and Dark) themes for Jenkins.

Learn more about the Solarized color scheme https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized[on its website].

IMPORTANT: This plugin is still an early work in progress. Jenkins isn't quite as themeable as we would like yet, so some things will not look as expected. Help in developing this theme, and Jenkins theming support in general, would be appreciated.
